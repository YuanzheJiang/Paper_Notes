**Notable information:** 

* **Decompose SED**
* **Fitting host**



Nucleus outburst $\rightarrow$ changing - look

<u>A way to examine a thermally emitting thin disk around a BH</u>



3.2 Wavelength-dependent Variability Lags and Temporal Smoothing

* Combine different bands (less data point)

* Javelin Lags
* Smooth?



3.3 SED

* **Composite SED**

​		<u>**Worth trying: normalized to blue band.**</u>

​		Then maybe we can subtract the disk component in other band to find what may happen.

4 A Simple Quantitative Model

* Thin disk prediction
* Host
  * The contamination is reasonably well modeled by the Sbc SED template form Assef et al. 2010, ApJ, 713, 970
  * Thin disk + constant $\rightarrow$ SED $\rightarrow$ rms host component, align well with Sbc SED (no prior)

<u>\# Maybe we can use the host SED to confine other component? For example, we assume 3 component: disk, DC and constant. And we find the constant part fits well with the host SED.</u>
